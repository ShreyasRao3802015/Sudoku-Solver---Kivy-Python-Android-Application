<h2 id = 'overview'> Overview </h2>
<p>
This project is an attempt to build an android application that helps the user to solve a sudoku puzzle. This application is build using the <a href= 'https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjyrKvyo5DtAhU1juYKHQrQBZkQFjAAegQIARAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fkivy.org%2F&usg=AOvVaw2sQzH6hugoCP4InvINovCg'>Kivy</a> framework of python. It is a project that helped me actualize the OOP concepts, Back Tracking Algorithm and Kivy.
Finally I have built the APK using <a href= 'https://buildozer.readthedocs.io/en/latest'/>Buildozer</a>. Following are a few snapshots that were taken from an android phone.<br>

<h2 id = 'motivation'> Motivation </h2>
<p>
  I still remember those dreaded summer afternoons in my childhood when my father made me solve Sudoku. However, after solving about a score of these "mind-numbing" puzzles, Sudoku grew on me. Unknowingly, I had built my own algorithm that was intuitive to a human mind. <br>
  When I had finished learning quite a bit about Python Programming, I was searching for Projects that would leverage all that I had learnt regarding OOP Concepts. I took on this project because of the apparent connection I had with Sudoku; even if it meant for me to learn a new framework - Kivy. I also learnt about the <a href= 'https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/backtracking-algorithms/'>Back Tracking Algorithm</a> and how it can save a lot of computational hassle.

<p>
<ul>
  <li>I would like to thank my family for supporting my decision to pursue Data Science as career rather than sticking to my degree profession-Mechanical Engineer.</li>
  
 <br>
  
  <li>Next I would like to thank Great Learning for giving quality (both theory and handson) education during the pandemic times. I am sure they had to go to great lengths to provide what was initially promised as an offline course in an online platform.
  </li>
    
 <br>
  
  <li>I thank <a href= 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/namrata-thukral-50550772/'>Namrata Thukral</a> who is a faculty at Great Learning for sparing time out of your busy schedule to review this project and providing valuable insights.
  </li>
 
 <br>
  
  <li>Since this is my first Data Analysis project, I relied on <a href= 'https://www.kaggle.com/'>Kaggle</a> (needs no introduction in the Data Science realm) for acquiring the dataset. Thank you Kaggle for providing such a great platform for Data Science enthusiasts!
  </li>
 
 <br>
  
  <li>Finally I would like to mention Stack Overflow. I was able to solve Part 4) (What are the products that are most often sold together?) by understanding how itertools and counter libraries can be leveraged. To check out the Stack Overflow page click <a href= 'https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52195887/counting-unique-pairs-of-numbers-into-a-python-dictionary'>here</a>.
